# Analytics-Vidhya-Big-mart-Sales-prediction
This repositry holds the codes and models that were used in Bigmart sales prediction. I managed to get 136th rank out of 5000 people which is top 2.7% of ranks.

## Used Anova, Chisquare, information gain, Correlation, Variance gain to select important features
## Problem type : Regression
## Algorithms used : Random Forest Regressor, XGboost Regressor, Gradient Boost Regressor, Adaptive Boost Regressor and Neural Network Regressor.
## Best models in order: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boost Regressor and Neural Network Regressor

## Please note that there will be Randomness in data while training which might make you to get somewhere around 300 or <300 rank. Try tweaking hyperparameters.
